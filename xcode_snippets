# This script will configure Xcode to look for code snippets on your iCloud Drive
# FYI:
# Code snippets are stored here
# ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData
# iCloud drive documents folder is here
# ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/
#
# Let's get busy. 

# Move to Xcode settings directory
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData

# Back up (rename) the CodeSnippets folder
mv CodeSnippets/ CodeSnippets_bak

# Create new CodeSnippets folder on iCloud
mkdir ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/CodeSnippets

# Make a link to iCloud/Documents/CodeSnippets
ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/CodeSnippets/ CodeSnippets

# copy original snippets 
cp CodeSnippets_bak/* CodeSnippets/
